<h1><big>BESIDE<br />
STILL<br />
WATERS</big></h1>

<h2><small>BY ROBERT SHECKLEY</small></h2>

<div class="bq"><p><i>When people talk about getting away from it all, they
are usually thinking about our great open spaces out
west. But to science fiction writers, that would be
practically in the heart of Times Square. When a man
of the future wants solitude he picks a slab of rock
floating in space four light years east of Andromeda.
Here is a gentle little story about a man who sought
the solitude of such a location. And who did he take
along for company? None other than Charles the Robot.</i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Mark Rogers</span> was a prospector,
and he went to the
asteroid belt looking for radioactives
and rare metals. He
searched for years, never finding
much, hopping from fragment to
fragment. After a time he settled
on a slab of rock half a mile
thick.</p>

<p>Rogers had been born old, and
he didn't age much past a point.
His face was white with the pallor
of space, and his hands shook a
little. He called his slab of rock
Martha, after no girl he had ever
known.</p>

<p>He made a little strike, enough
to equip Martha with an air
pump and a shack, a few tons of
dirt and some water tanks, and a
robot. Then he settled back and
watched the stars.</p>

<p>The robot he bought was a
standard-model all-around
worker, with built-in memory and
a thirty-word vocabulary. Mark
added to that, bit by bit. He was
something of a tinkerer, and he
enjoyed adapting his environment
to himself.</p>

<p>At first, all the robot could
say was "Yes, sir," and "No,
sir." He could state simple problems:
"The air pump is laboring,
sir." "The corn is budding, sir."
He could perform a satisfactory
salutation: "Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>Mark changed that. He eliminated
the "sirs" from the robot's
vocabulary; equality was the rule
on Mark's hunk of rock. Then he
dubbed the robot Charles, after a
father he had never known.</p>

<p>As the years passed, the air
pump began to labor a little as it
converted the oxygen in the planetoid's
rock into a breathable atmosphere.
The air seeped into
space, and the pump worked a
little harder, supplying more.</p>

<p>The crops continued to grow
on the tamed black dirt of the
planetoid. Looking up, Mark
could see the sheer blackness of
the river of space, the floating
points of the stars. Around him,
under him, overhead, masses of
rock drifted, and sometimes the
starlight glinted from their black
sides. Occasionally, Mark caught
a glimpse of Mars or Jupiter.
Once he thought he saw Earth.</p>

<p>Mark began to tape new responses
into Charles. He added
simple responses to cue words.
When he said, "How does it
look?" Charles would answer,
"Oh, pretty good, I guess."</p>

<p>At first the answers were what
Mark had been answering himself,
in the long dialogue held
over the years. But, slowly, he
began to build a new personality
into Charles.</p>

<p>Mark had always been suspicious
and scornful of women.
But for some reason he didn't
tape the same suspicion into
Charles. Charles' outlook was
quite different.</p>

<hr />

<p>"What do you think of girls?"
Mark would ask, sitting on a
packing case outside the shack,
after the chores were done.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. You have
to find the right one." The robot
would reply dutifully, repeating
what had been put on its tape.</p>

<p>"I never saw a good one yet,"
Mark would say.</p>

<p>"Well, that's not fair. Perhaps
you didn't look long enough.
There's a girl in the world for
every man."</p>

<p>"You're a romantic!" Mark
would say scornfully. The robot
would pause&mdash;a built-in pause&mdash;and
chuckle a carefully constructed
chuckle.</p>

<p>"I dreamed of a girl named
Martha once," Charles would
say. "Maybe if I would have
looked, I would have found her."</p>

<p>And then it would be bedtime.
Or perhaps Mark would want
more conversation. "What do you
think of girls?" he would ask
again, and the discussion would
follow its same course.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="376" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Charles grew old. His limbs
lost their flexibility, and some of
his wiring started to corrode.
Mark would spend hours keeping
the robot in repair.</p>

<p>"You're getting rusty," he
would cackle.</p>

<p>"You're not so young yourself,"
Charles would reply. He
had an answer for almost everything.
Nothing involved, but an
answer.</p>

<p>It was always night on Martha,
but Mark broke up his time into
mornings, afternoons and evenings.
Their life followed a simple
routine. Breakfast, from vegetables
and Mark's canned store.
Then the robot would work in
the fields, and the plants grew
used to his touch. Mark would
repair the pump, check the water
supply, and straighten up the
immaculate shack. Lunch, and
the robot's chores were usually
finished.</p>

<hr />

<p>The two would sit on the packing
case and watch the stars.
They would talk until supper,
and sometimes late into the endless
night.</p>

<p>In time, Mark built more complicated
conversations into
Charles. He couldn't give the
robot free choice, of course, but
he managed a pretty close approximation
of it. Slowly, Charles'
personality emerged. But it was
strikingly different from Mark's.</p>

<p>Where Mark was querulous,
Charles was calm. Mark was
sardonic, Charles was naive. Mark
was a cynic, Charles was an
idealist. Mark was often sad;
Charles was forever content.</p>

<p>And in time, Mark forgot he
had built the answers into
Charles. He accepted the robot
as a friend, of about his own age.
A friend of long years' standing.</p>

<p>"The thing I don't understand,"
Mark would say, "is why
a man like you wants to live here.
I mean, it's all right for me. No
one cares about me, and I never
gave much of a damn about anyone.
But why you?"</p>

<p>"Here I have a whole world,"
Charles would reply, "where on
Earth I had to share with billions.
I have the stars, bigger and
brighter than on Earth. I have
all space around me, close, like
still waters. And I have you,
Mark."</p>

<p>"Now, don't go getting sentimental
on me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not. Friendship counts.
Love was lost long ago, Mark.
The love of a girl named Martha,
whom neither of us ever met.
And that's a pity. But friendship
remains, and the eternal night."</p>

<p>"You're a bloody poet," Mark
would say, half admiringly. "A
poor poet."</p>

<hr />

<p>Time passed unnoticed by the
stars, and the air pump hissed
and clanked and leaked. Mark
was fixing it constantly, but the
air of Martha became increasingly
rare. Although Charles labored in
the fields, the crops, deprived of
sufficient air, died.</p>

<p>Mark was tired now, and barely
able to crawl around, even without
the grip of gravity. He stayed
in his bunk most of the time.
Charles fed him as best he could,
moving on rusty, creaking limbs.</p>

<p>"What do you think of girls?"</p>

<p>"I never saw a good one yet."</p>

<p>"Well, that's not fair."</p>

<p>Mark was too tired to see the
end coming, and Charles wasn't
interested. But the end was on
its way. The air pump threatened
to give out momentarily. There
hadn't been any food for days.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/002.png" width="205" height="268" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>"But why you?" Gasping in
the escaping air. Strangling.</p>

<p>"Here I have a whole world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't get sentimental&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the love of a girl named
Martha."</p>

<p>From his bunk Mark saw the
stars for the last time. Big, bigger
than ever, endlessly floating in
the still waters of space.</p>

<p>"The stars ..." Mark said.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"The sun?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;shall shine as now."</p>

<p>"A bloody poet."</p>

<p>"A poor poet."</p>

<p>"And girls?"</p>

<p>"I dreamed of a girl named
Martha once. Maybe if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you think of girls?
And stars? And Earth?" And it
was bedtime, this time forever.</p>

<p>Charles stood beside the body
of his friend. He felt for a pulse
once, and allowed the withered
hand to fall. He walked to a
corner of the shack and turned
off the tired air pump.</p>

<p>The tape that Mark had prepared
had a few cracked inches
left to run. "I hope he finds his
Martha," the robot croaked, and
then the tape broke.</p>

<p>His rusted limbs would not
bend, and he stood frozen, staring
back at the naked stars. Then he
bowed his head.</p>

<p>"The Lord is my shepherd,"
Charles said. "I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures; he leadeth
me ..."</p>
